    <h3>2. Cookies </h3>
    What are cookies?

    Cookies are small pieces of data that a website asks your browser to store on your computer, laptop or mobile device
    when you visit a website or certain pages of that specific website. The cookie allows that website to “remember”
    your actions or preferences over time and to apply them during subsequent visits, for example your preferred
    language.

    Cookies usually contain the name of the website where the cookie has come from, how long the cookie will remain on
    your device (its expiry date), and a value which is usually a randomly generated unique number.

    A distinction is made between strictly necessary cookies and other cookies.

    The strictly necessary cookies are necessary for the proper functioning of the Website, for example for the security
    of our Website and its accessibility. By virtue of the applicable legislation, we are not required to ask your
    consent to use such cookies.

    A further distinction on the basis of the category can be made according to the specific purpose of the cookie. For
    each of these categories (unless they are strictly necessary), we will ask your consent.

    Cookies can be divided into the following categories:

    a) Permanent cookies and session cookies: The task of a permanent cookie is to recognize the web browser with a view
    to repeat visits to the Website, while the task of a session cookie is to recognize the web browser during the visit
    to the Website. Permanent cookies will remain stored on your computer or mobile device. Session cookies will be
    deleted at the end of every session.

    b) First party cookies and third party cookies: first party cookies are set by the Website itself. Third party
    cookies are set by other websites than our Website. This happens when our Website incorporates elements from other
    websites, such as social media plug-ins or advertisements that are put on our Website.

    c) Performance cookies and functional cookies: performance cookies monitor how the visitor uses the Website. This
    enables the website administrator to adjust and optimize the content and ease of use of the Website (for example:
    how many people have visited the different pages on the Website and which language is the most popular amongst our
    visitors). Functional cookies are cookies that remember your preferences when you use the Website, such as your
    chosen language, and will make the Website more user-friendly and enhancing your user experience.

    Cookies will not always contain personal data but may contain information that may lead to your identification, in
    which case such cookie shall be treated as personal data. To the extent a cookie can be considered as personal data,
    our Privacy Policy will apply. More information about privacy, data protection and your rights can be found in the
    Privacy Policy (privacy policy).

    Which cookies do we use?

    Our Website makes use of social media plugins. These social media partners use third party cookies. The following
    social media partners are used: Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and YouTube. We refer to article 5 of the Privacy Policy
    for how we use these social media plugins. For your information, we will also provide you the links to the relevant
    cookie policies:

    (b) Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/

    (c) Google+: http://www.google.com/policies/technologies/cookies/;

    (d) YouTube: https://policies.google.com/technologies/cookies?hl=en.

    Managing and blocking cookies

    When visiting the Website visitors will be informed (by means of a pop-up) which cookies are being used by us, and
    we will ask the visitor’s consent for the use of each of the cookies. You can at all times manage or delete cookies
    using the settings on your internet browser, allowing you to refuse some or all cookies, except for the strictly
    necessary cookies, since these cookies are essential for the visitor to browse the Website and its features. Turning
    off cookies will limit the service that we are able to provide and may affect your user-experience. Deleting cookies
    may result in manually adjusting preferences every time you visit our Website.
